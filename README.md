# TrelloX - Trello with focus.

TrelloX is open source and currently looking for contributors.

https://trellox.io

A Chrome extension to give Trello a more up-to-date user experience, reducing clutter and increasing focus.

## Features and use
### Clearer cards
- If you use mainly one label per card, TrelloX now shows the label as a stripe down the left of each card
- This greatly reduces screen clutter especially with lots of cards
- Toggle showing all labels again by clicking "Labels: New/All"

### Show card numbers
- Toggle showing card numbers on and off by clicking "Numbers: On/Off"

### CPU/Battery friendly
- As fast as Trello and doesn't drain CPU or battery

### Tags in card titles
- Use @ in card titles to e.g. @mention (displayed as &lt;strong&rt;)
- Use # in card titles to e.g. #tag (displayed as &lt;em&rt;)
- Use ! in card titles to e.g. denote !09:45 time (displayed as &lt;code&rt;)

### Line breaks in card titles
- Use '/n' in a card title to add a line-break to the title. Use several per card if you like!

### Separator cards
- Use '---' in a card title to create a separator card

### Collapsible lists
- Collapse lists using the arrow at the top of each list
- Collapsed lists are maintained between sessions

### Header cards
- Prefix a card title with 'h.' to make it a header

### Mobile friendly
- Gracefully degrades on mobile Trello

## Planned features
- Show multiple labels in new style (maybe)
- Undo for archiving/deleting cards
- Undo for moving cards
- Global keyboard shortcut for adding cards
- Collapse/expand all lists button

## Project goals
1. Add focus
2. Elegant and fast
